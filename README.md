This is a github page where I upload my modules from the boot.dev course. I have a habit of taking notes directly onto the webpage, so I've decided to upload them here instead for neatness and to make it easier to  look for these notes later.
This assignment was done based on the boot.dev project under the same name as this repository. 
Here is the link: https://www.boot.dev/
Thank you to the creator of boot.dev, Lane, for creating the courses and allowing me to post these notes.
