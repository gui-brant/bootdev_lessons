    Insertion sort is actually very useful! It works by keeping track of a number in the list and the value prior to it.
    It will swap those two numbers if j < j-1, and keep propagating backwards with that logic.
    If it can't propagate further or j-1> j, then increment i and move to it (i is just a forward tracker).
    It sounds slow and complicated, but when the data is small or loosely sorted, it's actually super fast.
