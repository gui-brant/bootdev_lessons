#Polymorphism means that you can create the same variable, object, or function with different bodies in different instances and call them to display that different body for every instance: 
class Creature():
    def move(self):
        print("the creature moves")

class Dragon(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the dragon flies")

class Kraken(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the kraken swims")

for creature in [Creature(), Dragon(), Kraken()]:
    creature.move()
# prints:
# the creature moves
# the dragon flies
# the kraken swims
