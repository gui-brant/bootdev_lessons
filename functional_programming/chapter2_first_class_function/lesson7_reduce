    #You actually solved this one pretty quickly all things consider. 
    #You understood that .reduce takes a function and just iteratively adds onto by accumulating into a single result.
    #The only issue was formatting. You were iteratively putting a "." at the end of each input, which caused problems.
    #As a rule of thumb, watch out when you're using functools.reduce() for these types of formatting problems.
