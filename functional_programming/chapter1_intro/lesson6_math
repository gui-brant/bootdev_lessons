        Steps: 
        1. Use sorted() to sort out the list.
        2. Get the length of the list using len()
        3. Divide that length by //2. Floor division rounds to the lowest number always, so it takes care of the condition.
        4. Create an if statement in case the list is empty.
        Issue:
        3. Recall that the indexes output from sorted start at zero. Therefore,
            len() for four-index list produces the value 4. 4//2 is 2, which is not
            the lowest of the two possibilities. Therefore, if even, this value has
            to be decreased by 1.
