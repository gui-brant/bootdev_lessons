What are lists good for:
Append: Appending an element to the end of a list, e.g. cars.append("ford") is (on average) O(1). We go directly to the end and add the element.
Index: Accessing an element by index, e.g. cars[2] is O(1). We go directly to the index and return the element.
What are lists okay for (if you do it too much, then it's bad):
Delete: Removing an element from the middle of a list, e.g. cars.pop(2) is O(n). We have to shift all the elements after the deleted element down one index.
Search: Searching for an element in a list, e.g. cars.index("ford") is O(n). We have to iterate over the list until we find the element.
