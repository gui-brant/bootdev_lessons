I guess this is just really interesting to note. Just like in Java, you can check for a boolean without having to set variables to True or False:
Common truthy values include:

true
42 (any number that isn't 0)
"hello" (any non-empty string)
[] (an empty array)
{} (an empty object)
function() {} (an empty function)
Common falsy values include:

false
0
"" (an empty string)
null
undefined
NaN (Not a Number)
