    #Encapsulation is the term used when we hide complexity.
    #Functions are a prime example. You don't know necessarily how they work, you just call them (know inputs and outputs).
    #That said, some stuff is publaic, while others are private.
    #Making data private is a way of encapsulating so it's easier to use the structures (since you just have to focus on what's important). We do that by using a double underscore like __init__
