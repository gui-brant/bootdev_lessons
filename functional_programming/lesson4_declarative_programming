OOP's main flaw is that you need to set the How and the What. This makes it so that code is cluttlered. Functional Programming skips the How part. This allows us to create a pipeline, clean flow to our code. In other words, FP allows to be declarive with our code, unlike OOP. Mathematics, for instance, is a declaritive language, hence why FP is often used for mathematical modelling. You don't worry about the How, but about what will the math do.
