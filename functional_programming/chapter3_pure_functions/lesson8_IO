#This was very stressed by the notes just now: pure functions, that is functions that only mutate things inside its scope including inputs,
#should be used whenever reasonable. They are considerably easier to debug and work with.
#I/O stands for input/output. In our context, it means interacting with the "outside world," that is anything not stored in the application's memory (like the internet, your hard drive, or a database).
#The above point means that I/O creates "side-effects" and makes your function impure.
#The whole point of the exercise is to show that printing to the console is a side-effect.
